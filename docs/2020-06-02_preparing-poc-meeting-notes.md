## Agenda

Why do a PoC

Model for PoC

Mandate from steering group

Deliveries from prep phase

Define deliveries
  1. Break down
  2. Assign responsible and participants
  3. Define dependencies
  4. Estimate duration

Question raised about needing input from Sanity on estimating duration, Tormod says Firoozeh is drafting an 
agreement on their involvement in the PoC process

Why do a PoC? 
- Assess whether an in-house development project with Sanity will meet CCOM needs to replace AEM
- Establish basis for estimating/planning for full implementation

=> Identify and create use cases => do necessary development => run use cases, document result => evaluate results

=> Identify & document total set of use cases => make estimation based in PoC results for full implementation


Question raised on how to define which use cases are critical and should be utilized in the PoC, CCOM has no experience
with running this kind of an evaluation. What should the focus be on, how much effort should be put into it, etc.

Concern raised by Tormod that Sanity's involvement should be that of a consultant, not as the main developers of the PoC
because otherwise we will get a streamlined sales pitch.

Andrea brings up point that we should all be aligned on what the definition of a PoC is in this case

Tormod walks through the PoC model flow chart

### Preparation phase for PoC
Steering group has released funding for and mandate for the preparation phase:
 - define PoC use cases
 - estimate PoC timeline/costs/etc
 - set up tech environment for running PoC
 
Results from estimation will be basis to decide on whether or not to proceed with creating the PoC or not

Deliveries for preparation phase:
 - Use cases
 - Agreement with vendor
 - Technical environment ready, not including development to execute PoC use cases
 - Estimates/plan => covers development, executing use cases, and documenting results
 
Current aim is to complete preparation phase by end of June

Tormod walks through the plan (excel sheet) for different parts of the preparation phase, assigning who is responsible for
which parts and making a draft of the schedule
