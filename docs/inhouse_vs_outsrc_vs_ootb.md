Notes:
- the table is supposed to represent the point of view of a customer (CCOM in our case)
- the _in house_ evaluation assumes the availability of skilled teams to solve the problem (which we have)
  - Additional skilled resources can be sourced on demand through existing consultant contracts depending on budget
- when developing in house, the control over requirements is lower with respect to outsourcing because in house developers will oppose unhealthy requirements, while external consultants would benefit from those (see also _alignment of interest_)
- about _alignment of interests_, in house developers and customers are both aligned in making the company thrive
- in house developers have interest in developing a future proof solution, when outsourcing this cannot be guaranteed (but can be controlled if there are IT experts on the customer side). When buying an out-of-the-box product, this all depends on how the product is further developed and is something that is outstide of our control.
- when outsourcing we are typically bound by contracts, which limits e.g. reaction to changes and control over requirements
- when developing a solution in-house, the knowledge and experience that went into making that solution stay within the company. This is a major benefit in the long-term as it will make any future work on the project easier as that knowledge can be documented and passed on. When outsourcing the project, we will only have this benefit if we choose the same vendor since they will be the ones that have the knowledge and experience.


## Major risks for in house development:
- Lack of experience in the specific task (eg, Adobe is known to deliver websites, Equinor is not)
  - We have the competence to develop a solution
  - We build experience, and the experience stays in the company (good for future development / maintenance)
- Due to lack of experience, we can have inaccurate estimates
  - Lean approach: focus on the MVP, then improve
  - Combination of services: we build a working solution (MVP) by combining existing, possibly commercial, services. If there is time and sufficient resources, replace commercial services with open source solutions
  - Can pull the plug at any point in time (bad for us developers, but clearly a benefit for customers)
  - Let's be honest, no one has accurate estimates
- Lack of focus (because there is no legally binding contract, we don't fear the consequences of a failure)
  - Conuous communication with stakeholders
  - Projects on which the boss applied no schedule pressure [...] had the highest productivity of all (Peopleware, DeMarco and Lister, 1987)
  - We all tend to tie our self-esteem strongly to the quality of the product we produce (Peopleware, DeMarco and Lister, 1987)
