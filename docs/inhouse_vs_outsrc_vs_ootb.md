Notes:
- the table is supposed to represent the point of view of a customer (CCOM in our case)
- the _in house_ evaluation assumes the availability of skilled teams to solve the problem (which we have)
- when developing in house, the control over requirements is lower wrt outsourcing because in house developers will oppose unhealthy requirements, while external consultants would benefit from those (see also _alignment of interest_)
- about _alignment of interests_, in house developers and customers are both aligned in making the company thrive
- in house developers have interest in developing a future proof solution, when outsourcing this cannot be guaranteed (but can be controlled if there are IT experts on the customer side). When buying an ootb product, it all depends on how the product is further developed, which is typically outstide of our control
- when outsourcing we are typically bound by contracts, which limits, eg, reaction to changes and control over requirements
