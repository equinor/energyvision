Notes:
- the table is supposed to represent the point of view of a customer (CCOM in our case)
- the _in house_ evaluation assumes the availability of skilled teams to solve the problem (which we have)
- when developing in house, the control over requirements is lower wrt outsourcing because in house developers will oppose unhealthy requirements, while external consultants would benefit from those (see also _alignment of interest_)
- about _alignment of interests_, in house developers and customers are both aligned in making the company thrive


- when outsourcing we are typically bound by contracts, which limits, eg, reaction to changes and customizability
