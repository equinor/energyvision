Notes:
- the table is supposed to represent the point of view of a customer (CCOM in our case)
- the _in house_ evaluation assumes the availability of skilled teams to solve the problem (which we have)
  - Additional skilled resources can be sourced on demand through existing consultant contracts depending on budget
- when developing in house, the control over requirements is lower with respect to outsourcing because in house developers will oppose unhealthy requirements, while external consultants would benefit from those (see also _alignment of interest_)
- about _alignment of interests_, in house developers and customers are both aligned in making the company thrive
- in house developers have interest in developing a future proof solution, when outsourcing this cannot be guaranteed (but can be controlled if there are IT experts on the customer side). When buying an out-of-the-box product, this all depends on how the product is further developed and is something that is outstide of our control.
- when outsourcing we are typically bound by contracts, which limits e.g. reaction to changes and control over requirements
- when developing a solution in-house, the knowledge and experience that went into making that solution stay within the company. This is a major benefit in the long-term as it will make any future work on the project easier as that knowledge can be documented and passed on. When outsourcing the project, we will only have this benefit if we choose the same vendor since they will be the ones that have the knowledge and experience.
