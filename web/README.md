## Guidelines

### CSS

We use [üíÖüèæ styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for CSS. We prefer CSS Variables to
interpolation functions. [The styled-components happy path blogpost](https://styled-components.com/) explains the concept nicely.

To structure the global CSS we follow the
[Inverted Triangle CSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/) approach.
