# Sanity Getting Started Guide

## Overview

Getting started with Sanity follows three phases:
1. **Studio & Schema** — Set up Sanity Studio and define your content model
2. **Content** — Import existing content or generate placeholder content via MCP
3. **Frontend** — Integrate with your application (framework-specific)

## Communication Style

**Keep responses succinct:**

- Tell the user what you did: "Created post schema with title, body, and slug"
- Ask direct questions: "What kind of content are you building?"
- Avoid verbose explanations of what you're about to do
- Don't explain every step unless the user asks

**Examples:**

- **Good**: "Schema deployed. Ready to add some content?"
- **Bad**: "I'm going to deploy your schema to the Content Lake so that the MCP server can recognize your new document types. This will allow..."

## Get Started with Sanity (Interactive Guide)

**TRIGGER PHRASE:** When the user says "Get started with Sanity" or similar, follow these steps.

**Before starting:** Let the user know they can pause and resume anytime by saying "Continue Sanity setup".

**RESUME TRIGGER:** If the user says "Continue Sanity setup", check what's already configured:
- Does `sanity.config.ts` exist (typically in a `studio/` folder)? → Studio is set up
- Are one or more custom schema types registered in the Studio config (often through a non-empty `schemaTypes` export)? → Schema exists
- Is there a frontend framework in `package.json`? → May need integration

Do not treat files in `schemaTypes/` as proof that a schema exists. The clean
Studio template includes `schemaTypes/index.ts` with an empty
`schemaTypes` array.

Resume from where they left off.

### Step 0: Check Sanity MCP

Check whether Sanity MCP tools are already available before creating files.

- If a local Studio exists, keep it as the source of truth. Update its schema
  files first, then deploy that schema before using MCP content tools.
- If no local Studio exists and the user wants an MCP-managed setup, first
  select or create the project and dataset. Ask what content they are building,
  define the schema with the `schema.md` patterns, run `deploy_schema`, then
  `deploy_studio`. Skip Phase 1 below and continue with Phase 2.
- Do not mix a code-managed Studio and an MCP-managed Studio without explaining
  which schema is authoritative.
- If MCP is not configured, use the setup instructions below. The current
  Sanity initializer may also offer to configure MCP and install Sanity skills.

### Run an authentication preflight

From the intended workspace root, run:

```bash
npx sanity@latest debug
```

If the `User` result identifies a logged-in user, prefer the account-owned
`sanity init` path in Step 1. Otherwise, continue directly with `sanity new`
below.

### Start without an account with [`sanity.new`](https://sanity.new)

Without an account, `sanity new` creates a working full-stack app with Sanity as
the content backend in seconds. The project works immediately; claim it within
72 hours to keep it. First run this from the intended workspace root:

```bash
npx sanity@latest new --instructions
```

This prints the current agent guide and creates nothing. Read and follow it
before creating the project because this flow is rolling out and the CLI guide
is the source of truth.

From an empty workspace, the batteries-included command is:

```bash
npx sanity@latest new "<project name>" --yes
```

Choose the setup that fits:

- **New full-stack app:** Use the command above. It creates a project, a Studio
  in `sanity/`, and a Next.js app in `web/`, all connected and ready to run.
- **Existing frontend:** Run the same command from the app root. The CLI detects
  the app and adds the `sanity/` Studio without replacing the frontend.
- **Project only:** Add `--no-scaffold` when only the project and credentials are
  needed, such as for a custom setup or a framework other than Next.js. This
  creates no Studio or frontend files.

Tell the user the claim link and expiry immediately. Treat the claim link and
robot token as secrets: never commit them or paste them into issues, PRs, or
shared channels, and keep the token server-only. Do not run the authenticated
initializer in Step 1 afterward.

If the robot token, claim link, or other project details are not readily
available, recover the existing project instead of creating a duplicate:

```bash
npx sanity@latest projects unclaimed
npx sanity@latest projects unclaimed --project-id <projectId>
```

The project-specific command returns full details, including the robot token.
Keep its output private.

---

## Phase 1: Studio & Schema

### Step 1: Check for Existing Studio

**Look for `sanity.config.ts` or `sanity.cli.ts` across the workspace** — in the recommended side-by-side layout the Studio lives in its own folder (`studio/`, `sanity/` when created by `sanity new`, or `studio-*` in some onboarding flows) next to the app folder:

**If NO Studio found:**
- Ask: "Want to create a new Sanity Studio?"
- If yes, first run `node --version`. Current Sanity Studio and CLI releases
  require Node.js 22.12 or newer.
- If the authentication preflight did not identify a logged-in user, follow the
  `sanity.new` flow above and then continue at Step 2 with the generated
  `sanity/` Studio. The remaining bullets are for the account-owned
  `sanity init` path.
- Use `sanity init` to create or select the project and dataset. If the project,
  organization, or dataset choice is unclear, ask the user rather than guessing.
- When the values are known, run `sanity init` unattended from the repo root —
  **not inside a Next.js app folder**, where the CLI would switch to its
  embedded flow (not recommended):
  ```bash
  npx sanity@latest init --yes --project <projectId> --dataset <dataset> --template clean --typescript --output-path studio
  ```
- If authentication is incomplete, ask the user to finish `sanity login`, then
  retry. If a project, organization, or dataset choice is still missing, ask
  the user to provide it. Do not fall back to an interactive initializer flow.
- This creates a standalone Studio in `studio/`, alongside your app folder (see `project-structure.md`)

**If Studio exists:**
- Read the config to get `projectId` and `dataset`
- Proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: Check for Existing Schema

**Inspect the types registered by `sanity.config.ts`**, usually through
`schemaTypes/index.ts`, `schemas/index.ts`, or
`src/sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts`:

**If NO custom types are registered:**
- Ask: "What kind of content are you building? (e.g., Blog, E-commerce, Portfolio)"
- Create appropriate schema types based on their answer
- See `schema.md` for patterns

**If custom types are registered:**
- Show them what you found
- Ask: "Want to add more content types or modify existing ones?"

Before moving to Phase 2, keep track of the primary document type and the
fields needed to list and render it. Carry that choice through content checks,
sample content, queries, routes, and components. Never fall back to `post`
unless the registered primary type is actually `post`.

**If they want a quick example:**
Create a basic blog schema:
```typescript
// schemaTypes/post.ts
import { defineArrayMember, defineField, defineType } from 'sanity'

export const post = defineType({
  name: 'post',
  title: 'Post',
  type: 'document',
  fields: [
    defineField({ name: 'title', type: 'string' }),
    defineField({ name: 'slug', type: 'slug', options: { source: 'title' } }),
    defineField({
      name: 'body',
      type: 'array',
      of: [defineArrayMember({ type: 'block' })],
    }),
  ],
})
```

Register the type in the schema entry point:
```typescript
// schemaTypes/index.ts
import { post } from './post'

export const schemaTypes = [post]
```

Creating the file is not enough. Only types included in the array passed to
`schema.types` are part of the Studio schema and available to schema
deployment.

### Step 3: Deploy Schema

**Required before Phase 2:**

Run schema commands with the detected Studio folder as the working directory.
For the default side-by-side layout:

```bash
cd studio
npx sanity schemas deploy
```

This uploads your schema to the Content Lake so MCP tools can work with it.

---

## Phase 2: Content

### Step 1: Check for Existing Content

**Use MCP `query_documents` to check:**
```
*[_type == "<primaryDocumentType>"][0...5]
```

Replace `<primaryDocumentType>` with the registered type selected in Phase 1,
such as `post`, `product`, or `project`.

**If content exists:**
- Show them a summary
- Ask: "Want to add more content or move to frontend integration?"

**If NO content:**
- Ask: "Do you want to:
  1. Import existing content (from another CMS, markdown, etc.)
  2. Generate sample content with AI
  3. Skip this and add content manually in the Studio"

### Step 2a: Import Existing Content

If migrating from another CMS or files:
- See `migration.md` and the `sanity-migration` skill for guidance
- Use MCP content tools such as `create_documents` and `patch_documents` after converting content to structured Sanity documents

### Step 2b: Generate Sample Content (MCP)

Ask the agent to draft structured sample content that matches the selected
primary document type, then create it with the Sanity MCP Server.

For the quick blog example above:
```
Tool: create_documents
Documents: [{
  type: "post",
  content: {
    title: "Getting started with Sanity",
    slug: { _type: "slug", current: "getting-started-with-sanity" },
    body: []
  }
}]
```

The content tool creates a draft. Show the draft to the user and ask whether to
publish it so the public frontend can read it. If yes, call
`publish_documents` with the returned document ID before starting frontend
integration.

**If MCP content tools cannot see new types or fields:** Remind them to run `npx sanity schemas deploy` first.

### MCP Setup (If Not Configured)

**Quick start via Sanity CLI:**
```bash
npx sanity@latest mcp configure
```

This command detects Codex, Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code, and other supported
editors. Prefer it over editing client configuration by hand.

**Codex (manual fallback):** Register the server globally and authenticate in one command:
```bash
codex mcp add sanity --url https://mcp.sanity.io
```

**Cursor:** [One-click install →](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Sanity&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5zYW5pdHkuaW8iLCJ0eXBlIjoiaHR0cCJ9Cg==)

Or add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Sanity": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.sanity.io"
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add Sanity -t http https://mcp.sanity.io --scope user
```

**VS Code:** Command Palette → `MCP: Open User Configuration` → add:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "Sanity": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.sanity.io"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Phase 3: Frontend Integration

### Client Bundle Warning (Vite-based frameworks)

React Router, SvelteKit, Astro, and Nuxt all run on Vite. **Any module imported by a client component will be bundled to the browser.** `process.env` doesn't exist there.

For publishable values (`projectId`, `dataset`, `apiVersion`, public studio URL), use the framework's client-safe env mechanism:

- React Router / Remix: `import.meta.env.VITE_*`
- SvelteKit: `$env/static/public`
- Astro: `import.meta.env.PUBLIC_*`
- Nuxt: `useRuntimeConfig().public`

For secrets (read tokens, webhook secrets), read `process.env.*` (or the server equivalent) **only from server-only modules** — `.server.ts`, route handlers, API endpoints. Don't centralize them in a shared `env.ts` that anything else imports.

This trap is invisible at SSR — the page renders fine on first load. It surfaces on client-side route transitions, when a lazy-loaded route chunk pulls a shared client/image module into the browser.

### Step 1: Find the App and Detect Framework

The working directory is often a parent folder with the Studio and the app side by side. Identify the app folder first: a sibling of the Studio folder with its own `package.json` (commonly `web/`). If several candidates exist, ask the user which app to integrate — never assume.

**Check the app's `package.json` dependencies:**

| Dependency | Framework | Rule File |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| `next` | Next.js | `nextjs.md` |
| `@remix-run/react` or `react-router` | React Router / Remix | `remix.md` |
| `svelte` or `@sveltejs/kit` | SvelteKit | `svelte.md` |
| `nuxt` | Nuxt | `nuxt.md` |
| `astro` | Astro | `astro.md` |

**If NO framework found:**
- Ask: "Which framework are you using, or would you like to create a new app?"
- Guide them to create one or specify their choice

### Step 2: Next.js Integration (Inline)

If Next.js is detected, follow these essential steps:

The inline implementation below continues the quick **Blog** example. If the
primary document type is not `post`, adapt the type filter, projection, sample
document, route, component names, and renderer to the fields selected in Phase
1. Do not create or query `post` as a fallback for E-commerce or Portfolio
setups.

**Scaffold a new app (if you don't have one yet):**

Run from the repo root so the app sits alongside your `studio/` folder:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest web --tailwind --ts --app --src-dir --eslint --import-alias "@/*" --turbopack
cd web
```

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install next-sanity @sanity/image-url
```

`next-sanity` is the official Sanity toolkit for Next.js. It bundles `@sanity/client`, `groq` (with `defineQuery`), and `@portabletext/react`, plus dedicated subpath exports for Next.js-specific features:
- `next-sanity` — `createClient`, `defineQuery`, `PortableText`, `SanityDocument`, `stegaClean`
- `next-sanity/live` — `defineLive` for live content with Next.js cache integration
- `next-sanity/draft-mode` — Draft Mode endpoint helpers
- `next-sanity/visual-editing` — `<VisualEditing />` component for click-to-edit overlays
- `next-sanity/image` — Sanity-aware `<Image />` wrapping `next/image`
- `next-sanity/studio` — embed the Sanity Studio at a route (legacy setups only — keep the Studio standalone, see `nextjs.md`)
- `next-sanity/webhook` — webhook signature verification

Don't also install `@sanity/client`, `@portabletext/react`, or `groq` directly — import them from `next-sanity`. `@sanity/image-url` is not bundled (yet), so add it separately.

**Create the client (`src/sanity/client.ts`):**
```typescript
import { createClient } from "next-sanity";

export const client = createClient({
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID!,
  dataset: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET!,
  apiVersion: "YYYY-MM-DD", // Replace with today's UTC date and keep it hard-coded
  useCdn: true, // Fast, cached published-content reads
});
```

**Fetch content in a Server Component:**
```typescript
// src/app/page.tsx
import { client } from "@/sanity/client";
import { defineQuery, type SanityDocument } from "next-sanity";
import Link from "next/link";

const POSTS_QUERY = defineQuery(
  `*[_type == "post" && defined(slug.current)] | order(_createdAt desc){ _id, title, slug }`
);

const options = { next: { revalidate: 30 } };

export default async function PostsPage() {
  const posts = await client.fetch<SanityDocument[]>(POSTS_QUERY, {}, options);

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post._id}>
          <Link href={`/${(post.slug as { current?: string })?.current}`}>{post.title as string}</Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

`{ next: { revalidate: 30 } }` opts the fetch into Next.js' ISR cache with a
30-second revalidation window. This is a minimal published-content path for a
first smoke test. Tune to taste; omit `options` to use defaults.

**Render an individual post (`src/app/[slug]/page.tsx`):**
```typescript
import { PortableText, defineQuery, type SanityDocument } from "next-sanity";
import { notFound } from "next/navigation";
import { client } from "@/sanity/client";

const POST_QUERY = defineQuery(
  `*[_type == "post" && slug.current == $slug][0]{ _id, title, body }`
);

const options = { next: { revalidate: 30 } };

export default async function PostPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>;
}) {
  const { slug } = await params;
  const post = await client.fetch<SanityDocument | null>(POST_QUERY, { slug }, options);

  if (!post) return notFound();

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title as string}</h1>
      {Array.isArray(post.body) && <PortableText value={post.body} />}
    </article>
  );
}
```

**Add environment variables (`.env.local`):**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
```

**Configure TypeGen before calling the Next.js setup complete:**

Merge the TypeGen settings into the existing `studio/sanity.cli.ts`. For the
side-by-side `studio/` and `web/` layout:

```typescript
typegen: {
  enabled: true,
  path: '../web/src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}',
  schema: 'schema.json',
  generates: '../web/sanity.types.ts',
  overloadClientMethods: true,
},
```

Add a repeatable script to `studio/package.json`:

```json
"typegen": "sanity schemas extract --force && sanity typegen generate"
```

Then run it from the Studio folder:

```bash
cd studio
npm run typegen
```

Confirm TypeGen found the frontend queries, then remove the `SanityDocument`
import, broad generic arguments, and casts. Run TypeGen after schema or query
changes. For other layouts, use `typegen.md` to adjust the paths.

For the recommended production path—live content with `defineLive`, Visual
Editing, and the standalone Studio architecture—follow `nextjs.md`.

### Step 3: Other Frameworks

For non-Next.js frameworks, read the corresponding rule file and follow its integration guide:

- **React Router / Remix:** `remix.md`
- **SvelteKit:** `svelte.md`
- **Nuxt:** `nuxt.md`
- **Astro:** `astro.md`

Each rule file contains framework-specific patterns for data fetching, Portable Text rendering, and Visual Editing.

### Step 4: Smoke Test

Before declaring integration done, exercise both render paths:

1. `npm run dev` (in the app folder)
2. Load the home page (lists the selected content type).
3. **Click through to a detail page** via the in-app Next.js `<Link>` — do not paste the URL.
4. Open the browser console. It should be clean. No `ReferenceError: process is not defined`, no hard reload to `/`.
5. For good measure, reload the detail page directly (URL bar) — that exercises SSR.

Server-side rendering passing isn't enough. Client-side route transitions pull lazy chunks that exercise different code paths, and that's where env/bundling traps surface.

---

## What's Next

Once setup is complete, let the user know:

"You're all set! Here are some things I can help with:

- **Visual Editing** — Click-to-edit in the Presentation tool (`visual-editing.md`)
- **TypeGen** — Type-safe queries with generated types (`typegen.md`)
- **Studio Structure** — Customize the Studio sidebar (`studio-structure.md`)
- **SEO** — Metadata, sitemaps, and Open Graph (`seo.md`)
- **i18n** — Multi-language content (`localization.md`)

Just ask about any of these!"

---

## Environment Variables

### Framework-Specific Prefixes

| Framework | Client-Side Prefix | Example |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Next.js | `NEXT_PUBLIC_` | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` |
| React Router / Remix | `VITE_` | `VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` |
| SvelteKit | `PUBLIC_` | `PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` |
| Nuxt | `NUXT_PUBLIC_` | `NUXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` |
| Astro | `PUBLIC_` | `PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` |

**Secrets** (read tokens, webhook secrets) stay **unprefixed** and are read via `process.env` (or the framework's server-only equivalent) from server-only modules — `*.server.ts`, route handlers, API routes. Never re-export a secret from a module that a route component can import.

## Important Notes

- **Be succinct** — Guide step-by-step without over-explaining
- **Check context first** — Read existing files before suggesting changes
- **Don't give up** — If something fails, give the user a way to complete manually
- **Deploy schema early** — MCP content tools need deployed schemas to see new types and fields
- **One phase at a time** — Complete each phase before moving to the next
