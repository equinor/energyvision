# EnergyVision

This is the main repository for the EnergyVision project, home of the next version of the [equinor.com website](https://www.equinor.com). This version of the website is built using the [Sanity content platform](https://www.sanity.io/) as headless CMS and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the web frontend.

The project is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/equinor/energyvision/blob/main/LICENSE) following [the open source strategy of Equinor](https://opensource.equinor.com).

## Overview

This repository is organized into several folder. Please refer to README files inside each folder for more information.

- `studio` - [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) powered content platform.
- `web` - Web application using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and React components developed in isolation with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

## Storybook

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for the development of components. Pushing files to `./web/components` will trigger a build and deploy the Storybook - which can then be viewed here: https://envis-storybook.azureedge.net

"" PNPM

This project uses the PNPM package manager. All commands should be run from root. Thereâ€™s an alias in the package-file to studio and web. So to run scripts from the package.json in studio:

    # Install dependencies
    pnpm studio install

    # Start studio in dev mode
    pnpm studio dev

    # Add some package to studio
    pnpm studio add <some-package>

    # Build studio
    pnpm studio build

When adding arguments to scripts, such as --force to force a re-install of all dependencies, then when running scripts from the root, you must add `--` so that for example:

    pnpm studio install -- --force

Some packages take advantage of the flattening of node_modules and use modules that are not in their own package.json. This is usually solved with a pnpmfile, which can be a tedious process to maintain, so these dependencies have been added to the projects package.json directly. In studio, these are: 

- @sanity/form-builder
- @sanity/data-aspects
- postcss
- css-color-functions
