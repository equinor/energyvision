Drilling was concluded 1,515 metres below the sea bed.\u003c/p\u003e \n     \u003cp\u003eTraces of hydrocarbons were found at the expected reservoir level. Attempts to test the samples showed that the hydrocarbons were not producible, and the well will not be tested. \u0027Eirik Raude\u0027 will now move on to drill a further two exploration wells further east in the Barents Sea.\u003c/p\u003e \n     \u003cp\u003eThe drilling operations in the Barents Sea are being carried out in accordance with stringent environmental requirements imposed by the authorities for oil activities in the area. In spite of two accidental emissions during drilling, the operations at Obelix have not had any damaging effect on the environment.\u003c/p\u003e \n    \u003c/div\u003e \n   \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e \n \u003c/div\u003e  \n\u003c/div\u003e"}
